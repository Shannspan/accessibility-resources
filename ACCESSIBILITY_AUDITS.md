# Accessibility Audit Log

This document provides a log of all accessibility audits performed on this project. As this is an open source project, anyone can perform an accessibilty audit and report the results.

## How to perform an audit and use this document

### 1. ‚úÖ Perform the audit

At this stage, the type of audit you perform is up to you. Here are some suggestions, This is by no means an exhaustive list:

- Work through the [how to meet WCAG quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
- Test using assistive technologies
- Use the [A11y project accessibility compliance checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
- Check colour scheme for colour blindness with [whocanuse.com](https://www.whocanuse.com/)
- Check HTML pages using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

_Note, perform the audit on the [production version of this site](https://codelikeagirlau.github.io/accessibility-resources/), not your local version._

### 2. üìùLog the results of the audit in this document

- create a new file in accessibility-audits folder using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD_audit_yourgithubname.md`
- copy the content of AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md into your new file
- document your audit
- post a link to your audit at the top of the log

### 3. üíª Report issues in the [GitHub project issues](https://github.com/codelikeagirlau/accessibility-resources/issues) page

- Create new issues for accessibility problems that come up in your audit
- Create a single issue for a significant piece of work (e.g. review colour scheme of project for contrast) or group similar problems together in a single issue (e.g. a list of images requiring alt tags)
